            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Gabe Meredith, a Junior in High School with a passion for Machine Learning and AI technologies. I've been fascinated by the power of algorithms and data from a young age and have dedicated myself to learning and exploring this field.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in machine learning began during quarentine, where I signed up for a Data Science course, and since then, I've been involved in ML and Deep Learning. I am proficient in Python, Pytorch, Java, JavaScript, and am currently working on learning c++ for robotics. I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.</p>
    
            <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing chess, working out, and playing video games. These activities not only give me a break from the technical world but also provide me with a fresh perspective that I bring into my work.</p>
    
            <p>I am excited about the potential of AI to make a positive impact in the world, and I am eager to contribute to this field. Check out my portfolio below to see some of the projects I've worked on!</p>
